    <body>
        <h1>WADL Json Schema WebApp Example</h1>

        <p>This example demonstrates the wadl-json-schema extension module. It generates JSON Schemas for produced/consumed
            types and exposes it under <code>application.wadl/[bean-name]</code> path. It also changes the
            <code>&lt;representation&gt;</code>
            element in
            WADL xml by adding references to the schemas.</p>

        <h2>Running the Example</h2>

        <p>You can run the example using jetty as follows:</p>

        <p>run
        <blockquote><code>mvn clean package jetty:run</code></blockquote>
        <p>Get the generated wadl via curl or browser:</p>
        <blockquote><code>curl http://localhost:8080/wadl-json-schema-webapp/application.wadl</blockquote>
        <p>See the generated JSON schema at:</p>
        <blockquote><code>curl http://localhost:8080/wadl-json-schema-webapp/application.wadl/greetingBean</blockquote>
