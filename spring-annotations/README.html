<html><head><title>Spring Annotations Example</title></head>


  <body>
      <h1>Spring Annotations Example</h1>
      
      <p>This example demonstrates how to use spring and spring annotations, which requires spring &gt;= 2.5. Included is an example
        that shows how to use spring-aop with jersey - use spring-aop as you're used to it with your spring bean (spring managed resource class).</p>
      <p>There's also an example resource (<code>JerseyAutowiredResource</code>) that shows how to use annotation based autowiring with spring &lt; 2.5
        (via the <code>@Autowire</code> annotation provided by jersey-spring).
      </p>
      
      <h2>Contents</h2>
      <p>The example consists of four resource classes:</p>
      <dl>
      
          <dt><code>com.sun.jersey.samples.springannotations.resources.SpringResourcedResource</code></dt>
          <dd>A resource class that demonstrates the usage of the
            <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/annotation/Resource.html">@Resource</a> annotation
            provided/supported since spring-2.5+.</dd>
            
          <dt><code>com.sun.jersey.samples.springannotations.resources.SpringAutowiredResource</code></dt>
          <dd>A resource class that demonstrates the usage of the 
            <a href="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Autowired.html">@Autowired</a>
            annotation provided by spring-2.5+.</dd>
            
          <dt><code>com.sun.jersey.samples.springannotations.resources.aop.SpringAopResource</code></dt>
          <dd>A resource class that demonstrates the usage of 
            <a href="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/aop.html">spring-aop</a>.
            The resource method (of the spring managed resource class) is annotated with a custom <code>@Secure</code>
            annotation. A <code>SecurityAdvice</code> is defined with a pointcut matching methods with this
            annotation (this dummy advice just logs to stdout). The resource class <strong>must</strong> be managed by
            spring so that spring-aop can come into play.<br/>
            The resource class also has a subresource locator that obtains the subresource instance from
            the <code>ResourceContext</code>, so that this subresource instance is also created and proxied by spring.</dd>
            
          <dt><code>com.sun.jersey.samples.springannotations.resources.jerseymanaged.JerseyAutowiredResource</code></dt>
          <dd>A resource class that demonstrates the usage of the 
            <a href="http://jersey.java.net/nonav/apidocs/latest/contribs/jersey-spring/com/sun/jersey/api/spring/Autowire.html">@Autowire</a>
            annotation provided by jersey-spring (for users of spring &lt; 2.5).</dd>
            
      </dl>
    <p>The mapping of the URI path space is presented in the following table:</p>
	<table border="1">
	<tr>
	<th>URI path</th>
	<th>Resource class</th>
	<th>HTTP methods</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>/spring-resourced</td>
	<td>SpringResourcedResource</td>
	<td>GET</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
    <td>/spring-autowired</td>
    <td>SpringAutowiredResource</td>
    <td>GET</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>/spring-aop</td>
    <td>SpringAopResource</td>
    <td>GET</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>/spring-aop/subresource</td>
    <td>SpringAopSubResource</td>
    <td>GET</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>/jersey-autowired</td>
    <td>JerseyAutowiredResource</td>
    <td>GET</td>
    </tr>
	</table>

      <h2>Running the Example</h2>
      <p>If you are working with Jersey GlassFish update center module installed into your existing GlassFish instance, 
you will need to follow instructions at <a href="../../README.html">the module README file</a> in order to deploy the example.
<p>Otherwise, you can run the example using embedded GlassFish as follows:</p>
      <p> run 
      <blockquote><code>mvn clean package embedded-glassfish:run</code></blockquote>
      <p>or you can run the example using Jetty as follows:</p>
      <blockquote><code>mvn clean package jetty:run</code></blockquote>
      <p>From a web browser, visit:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <code><a href="http://localhost:8080/spring/spring-resourced">http://localhost:8080/spring/spring-resourced</a></code>
