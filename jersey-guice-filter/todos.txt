1) Check that it works properly with other container types like Grizzly, External GlassFish, etc.

add this text to bottom of README.html after verifying that it works properly using these other containers specified below:

<p>You can run the example using other container types like Grizzly, External GlassFish, etc. as follows:
            <p>You can run the example using Grizzly as follows:</p>
         <!--jersey-test-framework-grizzly-->
          <blockquote><code>mvn clean package -Djersey.test.containerFactory=com.sun.jersey.test.framework.spi.container.grizzly.web.GrizzlyWebTestContainerFactory</code>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote><code>mvn clean package -Djersey.test.containerFactory=com.sun.jersey.test.framework.spi.container.grizzly.GrizzlyTestContainerFactory</code>
          </blockquote>

          <p>You can run the example using HTTPContainer as follows:</p>
          <!--jersey-test-framework-http-->
          <blockquote><code>mvn clean package  -Djersey.test.containerFactory=com.sun.jersey.test.framework.spi.container.http.HTTPContainerFactory</code>
          </blockquote>

          <p>You can run the example using InMemoryContainer as follows:</p>
          <!--jersey-test-framework-inmemory-->
          <blockquote><code>mvn clean package -Djersey.test.containerFactory=com.sun.jersey.test.framework.spi.container.inmemory.InMemoryTestContainerFactory</code>
          </blockquote>


          <!--<p>Otherwise, you can run the example using embedded GlassFish as follows:</p>-->
          <!--jersey-test-framework-embedded-glassfish-->
          <!--mvn clean install -Djersey.test.containerFactory=com.sun.jersey.test.framework.spi.container.embedded.glassfish.TestContainerFactory-->


          <p>You can run the example using external Container as follows:</p>
          <!--jersey-test-framework-external-->
          <blockquote><code>mvn clean package install -Djersey.test.containerFactory=com.sun.jersey.test.framework.spi.container.external.ExternalTestContainerFactory</code>
          </blockquote>

2)  remove the exclude clause referring to the sample todos.txt at the samples/assembly.xml file, and then remove todos.txt
